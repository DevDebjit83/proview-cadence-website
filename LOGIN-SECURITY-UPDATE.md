## 🔧 HOW TO CHANGE CREDENTIALS

If you want to change the default username/password:

### Step 1: Open js/admin.js

### Step 2: Find the credentials section:
```javascript
const ADMIN_CREDENTIALS = {
    username: 'admin',
    password: 'admin123'
};
```

### Step 3: Change to your values:
```javascript
const ADMIN_CREDENTIALS = {
    username: 'your_username',
    password: 'your_secure_password'
};
```

### Step 4: Save the file

**That's it!** New credentials will work immediately.

## 💡 RECOMMENDED: CHANGE DEFAULT CREDENTIALS

For better security, change the default credentials to something unique:

### Good Password Practices:

1. **Use Strong Password:**
   ```
   ✅ Mix letters, numbers, symbols
   ✅ At least 12 characters
   ✅ Not a common word
   
   Example: MyS3cur3P@ssw0rd!2025
   ```

2. **Unique Username:**
   ```
   ✅ Not "admin" 
   ✅ Not your company name
   ✅ Something memorable but not obvious
   
   Example: devmaster2025
   ```

3. **Keep It Safe:**
   ```
   ✅ Write it down securely
   ✅ Use a password manager
   ✅ Don't share with unauthorized people
   ```
