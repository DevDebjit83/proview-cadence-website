# 🚂 Railway Deployment Guide - ProView Cadence Dynamic Backend

## ✅ What's Been Prepared

All code is ready for Railway deployment:
- ✅ `server-dynamic.py` updated with PORT environment variable
- ✅ `railway.json` configuration file created
- ✅ `Procfile` deployment instructions created
- ✅ All files committed and pushed to GitHub

---

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Sign Up to Railway (1 minute)

1. Go to: https://railway.app/new
2. Click **"Login with GitHub"**
3. Authorize Railway to access your repositories
4. ✅ You're logged in!

**Cost:** FREE - $5 credit per month (No credit card required)

---

### Step 2: Deploy Your Backend (2 minutes)

1. After logging in, click **"New Project"**
2. Select **"Deploy from GitHub repo"**
3. Find and select: **`proview-cadence-website`**
4. Click **"Deploy Now"**

Railway will automatically:
- ✅ Detect Python
- ✅ Install dependencies
- ✅ Run `server-dynamic.py`
- ✅ Assign a public URL

**Wait 1-2 minutes for deployment to complete...**

---

### Step 3: Generate Public Domain (30 seconds)

1. Click on your deployed service
2. Go to **"Settings"** tab
3. Scroll to **"Networking"** or **"Domains"** section
4. Click **"Generate Domain"**
5. Copy the URL (looks like):
   ```
   https://proview-cadence-website-production-xxxx.up.railway.app
   ```

**SAVE THIS URL!** You'll need it to connect your frontend.

---

### Step 4: Test Your Backend (1 minute)

#### Test API Endpoint:
Open in browser:
```
https://your-railway-url.up.railway.app/api/data
```

You should see JSON data ✅

#### Test Admin Panel:
Open in browser:
```
https://your-railway-url.up.railway.app/admin.html
```

Login:
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `proview2024`

Make a test change and click "Save All Changes"

✅ If it saves successfully, your backend is fully functional!

---

## 🔗 Step 5: Connect Frontend to Backend

After you confirm the Railway URL works, we need to update your Vercel frontend to use this backend.

### Update Frontend API Calls

We'll update these files to point to your Railway URL:
- `js/app.js` - Main site data loading
- `js/admin.js` - Admin panel save functionality

**I'll help you with this once you have the Railway URL!**
