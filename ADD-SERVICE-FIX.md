# ✅ ADD NEW SERVICE BUTTON - FIXED!

## 🐛 ISSUE IDENTIFIED

The "Add New Service" button was not working due to a **logic error** in the code.

### Problem:
```javascript
// WRONG ORDER - This was the bug:
editService(newId);              // ❌ Called first - service doesn't exist yet!
siteData.services.push(currentEditItem);  // ❌ Added after - too late!
```

The `editService` function was being called BEFORE the new service was added to the array, so it couldn't find the service to edit.

---

## ✅ FIX APPLIED

### Solution:
```javascript
// CORRECT ORDER - Fixed:
siteData.services.push(currentEditItem);  // ✅ Add to array FIRST
editService(newId);                        // ✅ Then edit - service exists!
```

Now the service is added to the array FIRST, then the edit modal opens.
