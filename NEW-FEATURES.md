## 📁 Working with Uploaded Images

### Important Notes

**Current Setup (Demo Mode):**
- Images are converted to Base64 and stored in JSON
- This works for demo but has size limitations
- Perfect for testing and preview

**For Production (Recommended):**
1. **Save Images Manually:**
   - When you upload an image, save it to `/images/gallery/` folder
   - Name it descriptively: `project-launch-2024.jpg`
   - In admin, use: `images/gallery/project-launch-2024.jpg`

2. **Use External Hosting:**
   - Upload to Imgur, Cloudinary, or similar
   - Use the hosted URL in admin panel
   - Best for performance and scalability

3. **Set Up Backend (Advanced):**
   - Create server-side upload handler
   - Store images on server
   - Reference stored paths in JSON

   - **Option B:** Click "Upload Image" and select file
5. Add technologies, category, description
6. Mark as "Featured" if desired
7. Click "Save Changes"

### Image Best Practices

- **Gallery:** 800x600px or higher
- **Aspect Ratio:** 4:3 or 16:9 works best

**File Size:**
